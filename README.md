to notify me!

# Can I Use This?

You are 1,000,000% free to do what you want with this, complain about it if you must!

# How Do I Use This?

If you download the 'Alp.h++' file from the releases page, and place it in your project, you can start using Alp immediately!

check the [Examples](Examples) directory for examples on what Alp does, but don't forget to either use ```alp::String```, (or any other feature of the alp namespace respectively) 
or include ```using namespace alp;``` at the top of your file before using anything from the alp namespace!
