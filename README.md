# Alp

Alp is a open-source (my favorite) C++ extension.

Alp is open to change, meaning if you have any deep-rooted grudges with Alp, feel free
to notify me!

# What Even Is An Alp?

1. Definitions from the Oxford dictionary state that an 'alp' (noun) is... "a high mountain, especially a snowcapped one."
2. Alp is an extension to C++, which sprinkles in a few features that I found I wanted.

These include...
* A new String class ([Check this example out](Examples/String.c++) if you would like to know more)
* A new Int class ([Check this other example out](Examples/Int.c++) if you would like to know more)
* And more statements to cry over ([Check this other other example out](Examples/Statements.c++) if you would like to know more)

# Can I Use This?

You are 1,000,000% free to do what you want with this, complain about it if you must!

# How Do I Use This?

If you download the 'Alp.h++' file, and place it in your project, you can use it like 
any other header file!
